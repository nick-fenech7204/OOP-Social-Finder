# OOP-Social-Finder
This Python class efficiently scrapes social media page links from a list of URLs, including Facebook, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn.
As someone primarily focused on functional programming, this attempts a transformation of a previously crafted script, now adapted to adhere to object-oriented programming principles.

## Libraries
    pandas
    bs4
    requests
    fake_useragent
    requests

## Use-Cases
* Market Research: Gather social media URLs of competitors or similar businesses to analyze their online presence, engagement, and content strategies.

* Data Analysis: Use the scraped social media URLs as part of data analysis projects, such as sentiment analysis, network analysis, or demographic studies.
* SEO Analysis: Extract social media links from websites to analyze their impact on search engine optimization and online visibility.
* Competitor Analysis: Benchmark your social media presence against competitors by scraping their social media profiles for comparison.

## Additional Comments
This script was originally created in a Jupyter Notebook; however, it can be converted to a .py file. The Python environment also exists in Anaconda.

This serves as a simple example of the possibilities of data mining and enriching a database at no cost. Many functionalities can be added, such as error handling, using tuples instead of lists for multiple values to be processed through the class, and incorporating print statements to track the progress of the script. Feel free to customize this script to suit your specific use case.
